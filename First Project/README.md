# 1st-project
1st project June 2020
I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
I start with first building the grid, then added the flipping method with jquery, added colors and letters. Ended with adding the API for the final picture that shows up with the winnning of the game. I added the @ media query to set for use on different devices. Created a file for my project.
