# 1st-project
1st project June 2020
I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
I start with first building the grid, then added the flipping method with jquery, added colors and letters. Ended with adding the API for the final picture that shows up with the winnning of the game. I added the @ media query to set for use on different devices. Created a file for my project.

I had difficulty with the flip method. This took many hours. I tables can not contain any non table elements. The td can contain non table elements. So I change the HTML to put divs in the td to change the front and back of the cards. 

I would add add imagines to the tiles when flipped. I did not have enough time to add this feature.
